path should not have led you here. However, the fact that you are here?
This is important. Each time you hit the button, each time you make the
mistake every “oops” accounts for a chance of discovery. So, is this
my project? Being just one of them may not be the only point. Maybe it's
become our project. It is a fleeting moment where your curiosity came
across my invention, and we've created something altogether different
than anything else; connection.">
