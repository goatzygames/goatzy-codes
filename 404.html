you have turned into the story. Perhaps it wasn't even mine to begin
with, but now it's a story we share. Moreover, the most intriguing tales
are typically the ones that weren't even supposed to take place. They’re
chance encounters. This page can be the equivalent of an unexpected
visit to the wrong room where you meet your one true love or the
discovery of an outstanding idea in the physical world. Perhaps your
path should not have led you here. However, the fact that you are here?
This is important. Each time you hit the button, each time you make the
mistake every “oops” accounts for a chance of discovery. So, is this
my project? Being just one of them may not be the only point. Maybe it's
become our project. It is a fleeting moment where your curiosity came
across my invention, and we've created something altogether different
than anything else; connection.">
