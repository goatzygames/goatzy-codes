    <h1 id="First">Oops! Looks like this isn't a project of mine...<br><br><br>Or is it?<br><br><br></h1>
        <p id="LongText">On a deeper level, though, just think about it: what is 'mine' anyway?<br>
             Ownership, creativity, and the human impulse to manufacture<br>
              things are more ethereal than we sometimes comprehend. If I construct the<br>
               chair, it’s “my” chair. Nevertheless, when somebody else utilizes it, likes it,<br>
                and claims it as his own, how about it? The chair becomes a joint <br>
                experience, similarly to this webpage. Simply by clicking this hyperlink,<br>
                 you have turned into the story. Perhaps it wasn't even mine to begin <br>
                 with, but now it's a story we share. Moreover, the most intriguing tales <br>
                 are typically the ones that weren't even supposed to take place. They’re <br>
                 chance encounters. This page can be the equivalent of an unexpected <br>
                 visit to the wrong room where you meet your one true love or the <br>
                 discovery of an outstanding idea in the physical world. Perhaps your <br>
                 path should not have led you here. However, the fact that you are here?<br>
                  This is important. Each time you hit the button, each time you make the<br>
                   mistake every “oops” accounts for a chance of discovery. So, is this<br> 
                   my project? Being just one of them may not be the only point. Maybe it's <br>
                   become our project. It is a fleeting moment where your curiosity came <br>
                   across my invention, and we've created something altogether different <br>than anything else; connection.
